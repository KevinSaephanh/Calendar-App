# Calendar-App
This GUI Calendar application creates a window to display a calendar for the current year.

# Navigation
To transition between months, click on the buttons next to the month label. To navigate to the event window, click on the "+" label at the top right of the calendar. 

# Event Frame Add/Delete Features
To add an event, fill in the text fields in the panel on the left, then click the "Add Event" button. The panel on the right contains a list of the events for the current date labeled "Today's Events" and a text area below with the details of the event from the list which the user has selected. To delete an event, select the desired event and click on the "Delete Event" button.

# Data Storage
All event data will be stored in a ".json" file using the "EventJSON.java" file. Events added and deleted from the event window will appear/be removed from the .json file.
